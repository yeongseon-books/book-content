# Repository Agent Rules

> Persistent conventions for any agent (human or AI) working in this repository.
> Apply these rules to every post, every commit, every script run.

> **Migration in progress**: this repo is moving from `tech-blog` to `tech-writing` (multi-channel publishing pipeline). See [`MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](./MIGRATION_PLAN.md) and [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md). All 10 series have been moved under `content/<series>/` (Phase 6 complete). Path examples below use `content/<series>/...` accordingly. Tooling (`finalize-posts.py`, `to-medium.py`, `finalize-ai-web-dev.py`) resolves series paths via `series.yaml`'s `path:` field; never hardcode `ROOT/<series-id>`.

## Series catalog

Eight Azure series (52 posts × 3 variants = 156 markdown files):

- `azure-app-service-101/`, `azure-app-service-deep-dive/`
- `azure-functions-101/`, `azure-functions-deep-dive/`
- `azure-aks-101/`, `azure-aks-deep-dive/`
- `azure-aca-101/`, `azure-aca-deep-dive/`

Each Azure series has three variants: `ko/`, `en/`, `medium/`.

- `ko/<NN>-<slug>.md` — Tistory original (Korean)
- `en/<NN>-<slug>.md` — Medium-bound English translation
- `medium/<NN>.html` — Medium browser-paste-ready HTML. Generated from `en/<NN>-<slug>.md` by `.sisyphus/medium/to-medium.py` (which delegates HTML rendering to `to-medium-html.py`). Self-contained: PNGs are inlined as base64 `data:` URIs. Open in Chrome, select-all, copy, paste into a fresh empty Medium draft; the first H1 maps to Medium's title slot, the trailing visible `Tags: ...` line is copied manually into Medium's tag input field.

Plus the single-variant Korean series:

- `ai-web-dev-101/` — 7 Korean-only posts published to Tistory. Flat layout, no `ko/`/`en/`/`medium/` subfolders. Same conventions apply (H1 → tag line at the bottom → series TOC above references), with TOC heading `## 시리즈 목차` and references heading `## 참고 자료`. Series tags: `AI, LLM, 웹 개발, Python, Tutorial` (defined in `.sisyphus/medium/finalize-ai-web-dev.py`).

And the LLM series (3-variant like Azure):

- `llm-from-scratch-101/` — 9-part series (`ko/`, `en/`, `medium/`). PyTorch 2.x, ~720 LOC tiny GPT, TinyShakespeare. Series tags: `LLM, PyTorch, Transformer, Tutorial`.

And the RAG series (3-variant like Azure):

- `rag-deep-dive/` — 6-part series (`ko/`, `en/`, `medium/`). LangChain, FAISS, RAGAS source-pinned. Series tags: `RAG, LangChain, Vector Search, LLM`.

The single source of truth for the catalog is now [`series.yaml`](./series.yaml); [`SERIES.md`](./SERIES.md) is the human-readable summary.

## Post structure (mandatory order)

This block describes the canonical **source** posts (`ko/<NN>-<slug>.md` and `en/<NN>-<slug>.md`). Derived **medium artifacts** (`medium/<NN>.html`) follow a different shape — they are produced by `.sisyphus/medium/to-medium.py` and live outside the source-post structure. See "Medium artifact rules" below.

Every source post (ko + en) MUST have, top to bottom:

1. **H1 title** (`# Title`) as the first content line
2. **Body** (sections, code, images, etc.)
3. **Series TOC block** wrapped in `<!-- toc:begin -->` / `<!-- toc:end -->`
4. **References section** (`## 참고 자료` for ko, `## References` for en)
5. **Tag line** as the very last line: `Tags: A, B, C, D` (visible plain text, per-series set, see `.sisyphus/medium/finalize-posts.py`)

The TOC block sits immediately above the references section, separated by a single `---` divider. The tag line sits at the very bottom of the file (after the references section), separated by one blank line. Legacy `<!-- tags: ... -->` HTML comments on line 1 are removed automatically by `finalize-posts.py`.

## Medium artifact rules

`medium/<NN>.html` is a derived artifact, not a source post. It is regenerated end-to-end by `.sisyphus/medium/to-medium.py` from `en/<NN>-<slug>.md` (the script applies Medium-specific markdown transforms in memory, then delegates rendering to `to-medium-html.py`). No intermediate `medium/<NN>.md` file is written. `finalize-posts.py` does not touch the `medium/` directory; do not hand-edit medium files.

- Tag surface: visible `Tags: A, B, C, D` plain-text line as the very last line (matches ko/en source convention; no leading HTML comment). On publish, copy the comma list manually into Medium's separate tag input field; the visible line then gets removed in Medium UI or simply ignored — Tistory readers tolerate it, Medium readers see the body end at References.
- First line: H1 (`# Title`). Medium's web editor maps the first H1 in a fresh empty draft to the title slot, so the artifact MUST start with H1 — no preface comments, no front matter, no kicker line.
- TOC: the `<!-- toc:begin -->` / `<!-- toc:end -->` markers are stripped, but the TOC body lines are kept (Medium has no native series nav).
- Image refs: kept as relative local paths (`../../../assets/...`), NOT rewritten to raw URLs. The publishing repo is private, so `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs return 404. PNGs are uploaded manually via Medium's UI (drag-and-drop) when publishing; the local path tells the author which file to attach where.
- Headings: H3+ are demoted (Medium import compatibility).
- Tables: 2-col → `- **key**: value` bullets; 3-col → `**label**` header + nested `- key: value` bullets; 4+ col → kept as raw GFM table with `<!-- TODO: render this table as PNG -->` marker (Medium has no native table renderer; wide tables need manual PNG conversion on publish).

## Series TOC rules (apply to every post, no exceptions)

The TOC reflects each post's position in the series. Three states:

- **Past posts (idx < current)**: `- [Title](./NN-slug.md)` — linked, plain
- **Current post (idx == current)**: `- **Title (현재 글)**` (ko) or `- **Title (current)**` (en/medium) — bold, no link
- **Future posts (idx > current)**: `- Title (예정)` (ko) or `- Title (upcoming)` (en/medium) — no link, no bold

This rule holds even when all posts are already written. The TOC describes the reader's journey, not publication state.

### Variant-specific labels

- **ko**: heading `## 시리즈 목차`, current marker `(현재 글)`, future marker `(예정)`
- **en**: heading `## In this series`, current marker `(current)`, future marker `(upcoming)`
- **medium**: same as en, but links use `./NN.md` form (filename = numeric prefix only)

### Title source

TOC entry titles are pulled from each post's H1 (single source of truth). Never duplicate title strings into README or scripts.

## Reference section heading

- **ko**: `## 참고 자료` (never `## References`, `## 참고문헌`, `## 참고`)
- **en/medium**: `## References`

## Tag line (source posts only — ko/en)

- Format: `Tags: A, B, C, D` (visible plain text, NOT an HTML comment)
- Position: very last line of every **source** post (after the references section, separated by one blank line)
- Source of truth: `SERIES_TAGS` in `.sisyphus/medium/finalize-posts.py`
- Same set is used for ko and en source posts; medium artifacts surface the same tags as a leading `<!-- tags: ... -->` HTML comment instead (see "Medium artifact rules")
- The tag line is visible to readers (Tistory); it doubles as a copy-paste source when publishing to Tistory and Medium

## Image conventions

- Path pattern: `assets/<series>/<NN>/<NN>-<idx>-<slug>.{ko|en}.png`
- ko slug = en counterpart heading slug (preserves ko/en file-name symmetry)
- All diagrams source: Mermaid → PNG via `.sisyphus/medium/mermaid-to-png.py`
- ko/en/medium bodies all reference local relative paths (`../../../assets/...`); Medium PNGs are uploaded manually via Medium's UI on publish

## Image caption (alt text) policy

Image alt text in `![alt](src)` is **double duty**: it renders as a visible caption on Medium / in ebooks AND it is read aloud by screen readers. Treat captions as short descriptive fragments that name what the diagram is showing — not headlines, not body sentences, not questions.

### Korean (ko)

- 형태: **서술형 명사구** (subject + relationship/flow/comparison)
- 길이: **4–12어절**, 한 줄 안에서 끝낼 것
- 끝맺음: `흐름`, `구조`, `경로`, `관계`, `차이`, `비교`, `경계`, `단계`, `조건`, `반응` 같은 명사로 마무리
- **금지**: `~입니다` / `~습니다` 종결어미, 의문형 (`~할까`, `~인가`), 마침표/물음표/느낌표
- 좋음: `트리거가 함수를 깨우는 흐름`, `트래픽 급증 시 플랜별 확장 반응`, `Revision weight와 scale의 관계`
- 나쁨: `트리거는 함수를 깨우는 원인입니다`, `트래픽이 늘면 어떻게 반응할까`

### English (en)

- 형태: **sentence-case descriptive fragment** (subject + relationship/flow/comparison)
- 길이: **4–10 words**
- 케이싱: **sentence case only** (no Title Case)
- **금지**: 의문형, full sentences, trailing punctuation, Title Case
- 좋음: `Request flow with ARR Affinity enabled`, `Pre-norm and post-norm LayerNorm placement`
- 나쁨: `How Is This Different From a Traditional Web App?`, `What ZipDeploy actually means`

### Universal rules

- **절 번호 prefix 항상 제거** (`4.`, `5.`, `1)`)
- **나란한 H2/H3 그대로 복붙 금지** — 캡션은 그림이 보여주는 관점을 더한다
- **백틱 금지** in alt text — 식별자는 평문으로 (`host.json`, `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT`)
- **Em dash 기본 회피** — 필요하면 `:` 한 번만
- **scare quotes 금지** — 강조용 따옴표 쓰지 않음
- **위치 어휘 금지** (`left side`, `blue box`, `top arrow`) unless position itself is the point
- **Vague 라벨 금지**: `Big picture`, `한 화면으로`, `Decision tree`, `One diagram first`
- ko/en counterpart 이미지는 **같은 의미 기반 paired rewrite**, 독립적 스타일 선택 아님

### Anti-patterns (lint blocks these)

- Heading clones: `배포`, `Big picture`
- Question captions: `기존 웹 앱과 뭐가 다른가`, `Why only some users fail sometimes`
- Body sentences: `Worker는 ... 실체입니다`
- Section/list prefixes: `4.`, `5.`, `1)`
- Formatting noise: backticks, scare quotes, multiple separators, emoji
- Editorial slogans: `No Peeking at the Future`, `3am`

### Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/lint_captions.py    # exits 1 on banned patterns
```

## Pinned tag

External and intra-repo URLs in `medium/` files MUST pin to a commit/tag, never `master`/`HEAD`/`main`.
Current pin: `f24a126` (defined in `.sisyphus/medium/to-medium.py` as `TAG`).
When regenerating medium variants, update `TAG` first, regenerate, then commit.

## Mermaid conventions

- `flowchart LR` for architecture diagrams (event source on the left)
- Node/edge labels containing `()`, `/`, `;`, or `(.NET)` MUST be wrapped in quotes: `["Label (with parens)"]`
- Minimize crossing arrows; reorder subgraphs before adding more edges
- en diagrams: English labels only; ko diagrams: Korean labels

## Tone & style

- ko: natural `~입니다` register, senior-engineer voice, no translation smells
- en: senior-engineer Medium voice, no AI slop
- No emoji (use text `Pass`/`Fail` instead of `✅`/`❌`)
- All user-facing code is Python (FastAPI / Flask)

## Quality gates before commit

Run from repo root:

```bash
python3 .sisyphus/medium/finalize-posts.py    # idempotent: tags + TOC + ko refs
.sisyphus/style/check-ko.sh                   # ko translation-smell + im-not-ai S1 check (must exit 0)
```

Korean writing additionally follows the **humanize-korean** ruleset mirrored at `.sisyphus/skills/humanize-korean/` (source: [epoko77-ai/im-not-ai](https://github.com/epoko77-ai/im-not-ai), MIT). Before drafting any `ko/*.md`, scan `.sisyphus/skills/humanize-korean/quick-rules.md` S1 patterns and avoid them from the first line. `check-ko.sh` enforces grep-detectable S1 patterns automatically.

After regenerating medium variants:

```bash
python3 .sisyphus/medium/to-medium.py         # regenerate medium/ from en/
python3 .sisyphus/medium/finalize-posts.py    # re-apply tags+TOC to new medium/ files
```

## Operational scripts (in `.sisyphus/medium/`)

- `mermaid-to-png.py` — convert mermaid blocks in ko/en bodies to PNG references
- `to-medium.py` — convert `en/*.md` to `medium/<NN>.html` (browser-paste-ready: H1-first, base64-inline PNGs, native HTML headings/lists/tables/code, trailing visible Tags line)
- `to-medium-html.py` — helper module imported by `to-medium.py`; renders Medium-flavored markdown text to a self-contained HTML document
- `finalize-posts.py` — idempotent: tag line, ko refs heading, series TOC (Azure series, ko/en/medium variants)
- `finalize-ai-web-dev.py` — idempotent: same operations adapted for the single-variant `ai-web-dev-101/` series
- `add-tags.py` — superseded by `finalize-posts.py`; kept for reference

All finalizers are idempotent. Re-run any time the series catalog changes.

## When adding a new post

1. Write `ko/<NN>-<slug>.md` and `en/<NN>-<slug>.md` (full body, references included)
2. Insert mermaid diagrams as `flowchart LR` blocks
3. Run `python3 .sisyphus/medium/mermaid-to-png.py <ko-file> <en-file>`
4. Run `python3 .sisyphus/medium/to-medium.py <series>/en` to generate `medium/<NN>.html`
5. Run `python3 .sisyphus/medium/finalize-posts.py` to insert tags + TOC + normalize refs
6. Update `README.md` series table
7. Verify: no `## References` in ko, all 3 variants have tag + TOC, mermaid count = 0
